> ### Verify profiles you trust 💙
>
> A userscript that lets you appoint your own trusted verifiers and display verifications from their `app.bsky.graph.verification` collection.
>
> ⚠️ **extremely rapidly iterating so nothing is stable** - so far everything is still backwards compatible though!

## 🏗️ Usage

Add handles of Bluesky users you trust to your verification list. When viewing profiles that these trusted users have verified, you'll see a blue checkmark by their name showing community verification.

Click the "Trusted Users Settings" button in the bottom right corner to manage your trusted users list:

```
1. Add trusted users with their full handle (username.bsky.social)
2. View all profiles they've verified
3. Remove users from your trusted list as needed
```

When you see a blue checkmark (✓) next to a profile name, click it to see which of your trusted users have verified that profile.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey
2. Click the installation link or copy the script to your userscript manager
3. Visit Bluesky and you'll see the "Trusted Users Settings" button
